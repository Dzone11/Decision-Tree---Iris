# Decision-Tree-Iris
In this project, I am implementing a decision tree on the Iris dataset for prediction.

As part of my internship at The Spark Foundation, I applied the Decision Tree Algorithm to perform predictions on the Iris dataset. My goal was to build and visualize a decision tree classifier that can accurately classify the different species of Iris flowers. The dataset was already clean and did not require any preprocessing. I used a plot tree to display the graphical representation of the decision tree.
